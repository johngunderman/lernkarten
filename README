Lernkarten
----------
A "better" flashcard program
============================

Lernkarten attempts to solve many of the problems with current digital
flashcard solutions. 

1. Lernkarten stores decks in plaintext so that one can easily modify
the deck without using Lernkarten's deck editing tool. 

2. Lernkarten's sorting algorithm for deciding when to present cards
is subjectively better than other digital flashcard programs.

3. Other improvements which I haven't yet thought of :P
